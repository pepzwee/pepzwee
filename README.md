### I am a datahoarder and I scrape the interwebs. 🐙
Scraping requires millions of proxies 🤔 contact me and I can hook you up.

### Projects I've made or have an active hand in helping
- Steamapis.com (personal project)
- DashSkins.com.br (helped launch and maintain)
- Bandit.camp (helped with in-depth Rust pricing)
- Rubra.com (helped with broad information scraping)
- CSGODb.com (created and sold off due to lack of time)
- And some projects that required scraping knowledge that I'd rather not disclose :)

If you deal with scraping and/or proxies feel free to chat me up on Discord: @pepz

I build with ❤️ and if it's to do with Steam then a lot of hair pulling as well 👍
